## Assignment 6: Model Evaluation and Model Selection

### Objective: In this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience in evaluating the performance of machine learning models and selecting the best features for your model. The assignment will focus on the following concepts:

- Accuracy evaluation using cross-validation
- Confidence intervals for the accuracy or the error rate
- Hyperparameter tuning using grid search
- Evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, ROC-AUC
- Feature selection methods: Filter methods, Embedded methods, and Wrapper methods
- Feature extraction methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Dataset:

In this assignment we will use the "Bank Marketing" dataset. This dataset is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit (yes/no). 

The dataset contains 20 input features, such as age, job, marital status, education, and others. The target variable is imbalanced, with the majority of the clients not subscribing to the term deposit.

You can find the Bank Marketing dataset on the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing

For your convenience, the dataset has been dowloaded and can be found in the Data folder.

### Assignment:

Edit the file bank_marketing.ipynb and complete the tasks outlined in the notebook.
